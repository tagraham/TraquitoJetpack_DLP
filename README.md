# TraquitoJetpack

This is the source code for the [Traquito Jetpack WSPR tracker](https://traquito.github.io/tracker/).

Note:
- This is not an Arduino library
- This is a C++ library, you build your app, you flash directly to the pico via SWD (eg via [JLink](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-edu-mini/))
- There is no further documentation than this README (sorry -- see History)


History:
- I built this project not intending to make it visible to others
- Then I decided to make it visible to others, that's why some things aren't quite perfect


Finally:
- I hope you find something useful or interesting here
- Unfortunately no support is available for your use of this project
- All code subject to change at any time, with no warning, including going private
- Please see the LICENSE file
